1) post-order: Left-Right-Center
   pre-order: Center-Left-Right
   in-order: Left-Center-Right

2) Traversal: non-recursion DFS: stack
                            BFS: queue

3) Divide-conquer: has return value.

4) balanced tree: the height diff for the left and right are less than one
   complete tree: A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible
   full tree:     is a tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children
